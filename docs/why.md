# Why Lynk
## AeroGameFramework and Knit
AeroGameFramework is a robust framework for Roblox development made by Sleitnick and was very useful, as it managed networking and communication for for the developer. However, it forced the developer to write their code into a set structure and did not support any code outside of the structure. This is why Knit was later created. It allowed for developers to follow their own structure for their projects. Lynk includes the features of *both* of these frameworks. It has a given framework structure, but allows you to change the layout inside the `Layout` file. If the developer wants even more versatility, then Lynk supports code outside of the given structure, by using its creation functions from the Lynk API in `ReplicatedStorage`.
